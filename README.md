# My dotfiles

Used with GitHub Codespaces and my local dev environment.

## Context

Items in root of repo are used in Codespaces to make that environment more friendly.

Items in `./local` are used on my local machine. Including my `./local/Brewfile` which includes all the apps I use on my local OSX machine.

## Codespaces

Any dot file in root will automatically be copied to home directory in Codespaces environment.

## Local OSX Setup

To Install: `./local/setup.sh`

includes the following

- Homebrew
- commands and apps via Homebrew
- asdf for app versions
- gitconfig (specific to me)
- and others...

Cheers,
JM
