description: Create a meaningful git commit message based on current changes.
---

## Context

- Current status: !`git status`
- Current diff: !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

## Critical Rules

- Use three separate headings: What, Why, Notes. Avoid bullet points for What and Why
- Notes should highlight non-obvious implications, risks, and trade-offs
- Notes should highlight things reviewers should specifically watch for that aren't apparent from reading the code diff
- Avoid stating obvious facts or repeating What/Why
- **NEVER git commit or git push without explicit user approval** - ALWAYS ask first
- **Always sign-off my commits** with `-s` flag.** Make sure the `Signed-off-by` line is only there once at the end of the commit message and uses my git config user.name as the name.
- Create a meaningful commit message based on the changes above.
- Ensure it follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) specification.
- Do not mention that it was generated by an AI.
- If the issue-url ($1) is provided, add `Relates to $1` as the first line after the commit title to associate the commit to its issue.
