description: Create a meaningful git commit message based on current changes.
---

## Context

- Current status: !`git status`
- Current diff: !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER git commit or git push without explicit user approval** - ALWAYS ask first
2. **Always sign-off my commits** with `-s` flag.** Make sure the `Signed-off-by` line is only there once at the end of the commit message.
3. Create a meaningful commit message based on the changes above.
4. Ensure it follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) specification.
5. Do not mention that it was generated by an AI.
6. If the issue-url ($1) is provided, add `Relates to $1` as the first line after the commit title to associate the commit to its issue.
